# Real-Time-Cyber-Incident-Feed-for-Indian-Cyberspace
A framework for collecting and analyzing real-time cyber incident data related to Indian cyberspace using web scraping and machine learning.

This project, developed as part of an academic initiative, provides a real-time cyber incident feed framework focused on Indian cyberspace. It leverages web crawling, scraping techniques, and machine learning to identify, extract, and stream data related to cyber threats and incidents. The aim is to support proactive threat intelligence, especially for safeguarding Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) in India.

üöÄ Features:
Discovery of platforms reporting cyber incidents (using ML)

Real-time scraping of relevant data from the web

Structured feed generation for threat monitoring

Focus on Indian cyber ecosystem

üõ† Tech Stack:
Python (Scraping, ML models)

Scikit-learn / spaCy / Transformers (for ML/NLP)

Requests / BeautifulSoup / Selenium (for scraping)

MongoDB / SQLite (optional: for storing feeds)

üè¢ Developed For:
National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC), under NTRO (India)
